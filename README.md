# SuperSpector

SuperSpector adds an easy way to select a set of properties in the inspector and copy them to another node. No more copying properties one by one, no more duplicating nodes and then having to change back a bunch of things and no more mistaking copying ressources by reference instead of deep copy.

It works by adding a checkbox next to all properties in the inspector and by adding a bunch of select/copy/paste actions via a context menu to speed up your workflow.

It's very easy to install and use but you can still read the documentation here : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2aPsn72dOxQ-wBNGqLlQvrw9-SV_z12a1MradBglF4/edit?usp=sharing
